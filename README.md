### Middle Pyramid Special Rule
- **Top card (row 0):** Available when not covered
- **Middle row of 2 (row 1):** **LOCKED** initially
- **Bottom card (row 2):** **Always available from start!**

- Just like Webkinz!

### Draw Pile Mechanics (EXACT!)
- Click deck to draw a card
- Card appears next to deck
- You can use it or leave it
- Click deck again:
  - Previous drawn card goes to **highest empty spot** (top rows first!)
  - If no empty spots → goes to **bottom of deck**
  - Deck count stays same!

### Card Distribution (More Generous!)
- **More low cards:**
  - 8 copies each of 1, 2, 3
  - 5 copies each of 4, 5, 6, 7
  - 3 copies each of 8, 9, 10
- Easier to make 11!

### Visual Design
- **Blue gradient background** - cards stand out!
- **Bigger cards** - easier to see!
- **"Cards Left: 29"** next to deck
- **No Webkinz bucks counter**
- Clean and simple!
